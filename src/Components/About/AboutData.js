      "Since I was a child, I immersed myself in the world of technology thanks to my dad, Who at that time was studying a basic technique on systems. Watching him in front of the PC doing his practical exercises fascinated me, so I started tinkering on my own. I even attempted to create a video game in Unity without any programming knowledge, just following tutorials to the letter. That failed attempt (as expectedðŸ¤¡) convinced me to dive headfirst into continuing to learn more and more about computer scienceðŸ¥³.",

I like to lend a hand wherever I can to ensure everything runs smoothly (perhaps because I don't like seeing things not working quite rightâ€”maybe I'm a bit of a perfectionist, just a bit... hahahaðŸ˜…). On another note (as an additional piece of information that no one asked forðŸ˜…), I've always been interested in the world of art and culture. In school, I won several first and second-place medals in troubadour singing and drawing (who would have thought? Now I can't even draw a stickmanðŸ¤¡ðŸ˜‚).",

      "I'm not a big sports fanatic, but swimming has won me over. Although I haven't practiced it professionally for a while, I'm always ready to take a plunge when the mood strikes. And since we're talking about my interests, music is my constant companion. Not to mention cinema. I love watching movies and series, but not just for entertainment. I consider myself an expert critic (according to me and no one else hahahahaðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚), analyzing everything from performances to soundtracks, from camera angles to color palettes. If something doesn't click for me, I swear, I won't buy into it. What can I say? An exceptional beingðŸ¤­. Oh, and I also like taking photosðŸ“·.",
